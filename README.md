## Problem Statement
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. 
It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. 

A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual 
effort needed in diagnosis.

## Conclusions
The problem of overfitting and underfitting was solved and the model was well trained for predictions. Data augmentation, outliers, and class equalization
 were found to be useful in improving model performance in this case.
